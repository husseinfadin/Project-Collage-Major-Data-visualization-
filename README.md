Repo # Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees¶


The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012.<br> The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled here. [links](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv)
